# CAN Adapter

The CANTool utilizes a Teensy 4.1 and a general expansion port as an add on if needed. There are three CAN channels available for use as well as 4 LED's to be programmed for desired use.

## Testing

There are a few test programs located in the tests folder allowing for the device's functions to be verified. The tests within the folder include tests for the SD card, all 3 CAN channels, LED blinking, and the D-SUB.
